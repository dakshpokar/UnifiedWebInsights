## Abstract

Unified Web Insight is a approach that leverages Large Language Models to provide comprehensive feedback on websites by analyzing both their screenshots and HTML documents. In today's digital age, evaluating a website's performance and user experience remains a persistent challenge, especially given the complexity and dynamic nature of modern web interfaces. 

While prior work has primarily concentrated on isolated aspects such as visual design or code quality, there is a notable gap in comprehensive analyses that also consider SEO, performance, and user interface (UI) metrics. Our methodology extracts critical visual cues, semantic content, and technical metrics such as SEO rankings and load times.

We are building a novel pipeline that assesses websites on set criteria, using a diverse dataset scraped from publicly available websites, evaluating its effectiveness through a combination of quantitative usability metrics and performance benchmarks. This integrated approach aims to advance the current state-of-the-art in website evaluation by offering a more balanced and thorough analysis compared to traditional methods.
